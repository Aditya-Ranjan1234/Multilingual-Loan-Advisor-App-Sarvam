This is a placeholder for a bank logo image.

To create a proper placeholder image:
1. Create a simple 200x200 pixel PNG image with a light gray background
2. Add a bank icon or the text "Bank Logo" in the center
3. Save it as placeholder.png in this directory

Alternatively, you can download a free bank icon from a site like Flaticon or Icons8 and save it here.

For the other bank logos (hdfc.png, sbi.png, iob.png, icici.png, axis.png, bob.png), you can:
1. Download official logos from the respective bank websites
2. Use placeholder images with the bank names
3. Create simple text-based logos with the bank names

Remember to ensure you have the rights to use any images you download.
